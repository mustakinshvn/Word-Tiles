# Word-Tiles

Almost all of us has played piano tiles or have watched someone playing.

Word tiles is a lot like piano tiles. The screen will have 4/5 portions. In each
portions letters will fall from above through each portions serially and the player
will have to type the letters according the serial. A player will have 3 lives. One life
will be lost if the player misses to type a letter before the letter gets out of the
screen. For typing each letter correctly the playerâ€™s score will increase by one.
